# Generator-Circle

This script generates circles based on their diameters (only odd numbers). The output is displayed in the terminal.

## Requirements

- MakeFile (Optional)

## Run

### Make

```bash
make
```

### MacOS/Linux

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Windows

```bash
python main.py
```

## Issues

I can't come up with an idea for creating circles with even diameters.

## Planned Features

I plan to add visualizations using the Throve GFX library to display the calculation process.
